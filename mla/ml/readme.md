# Machine Learning Algorithms

## KNN

### Input of the Algo
* Data X of shape n,d
* Number of neighbors k to consider

### Classification
A point is assigned a class by considering the k neareast neighbors (in the training set) and taking the most represented class from those. If there is an equality between two classes.

### Regression
The assigned value of a point is the mean of the k neareast neighbors (in the training set).
