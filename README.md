- [ ] Gaussian process regression
- [ ] Hidden Markov model
- [ ] Multivariate adaptive regression spline

### Ensemble methods
- [x] Random Forest
- [ ] Gradient Boosting
- [ ] AdaBoost
- [ ] One vs rest/ One vs one classifier 
  
### Bayesian
- [x] Naive Bayes (Bernoulli, Gaussian and Multinomial)
- [x] LDA/QDA
- [ ] MCMC
- [ ] Importance sampling
- [ ] SMC
- [ ] Variational Bayes - Laplace approx (Murphy 8.4.1-2)

### Deep Leaning
- [x] MLP (to refactor)
- [ ] VAE ? (Partially done in class)
- [ ] GAN ?
- [ ] CNN ?? (simply a layer compatible with MLP ??)
- [ ] RNN/LSTM ?? (simply a layer compatible with MLP ??)
- [ ] Transformer ?
  
### Clustering
- [x] K-means
- [x] K-medoids
- [x] DBSCAN
- [ ] OPTICS
- [ ] Gaussian Mixture with EM algorithm
- [ ] Variational Bayesian Gaussian Mixture
- [ ] Generative topographic map
- [ ] Vector quantization
- [ ] Fuzzy clustering (ex : Fuzzy C-means)

### Data processing/Analysis
- [ ] PCA
- [ ] FDA
- [ ] ICA
- [ ] Elastic map/net
- [ ] CCA

### Multi-armed bandit
Algo seen in class to add and generalize:   
- [ ] UCB
- [ ] kl UCB
- [ ] ETC 
- [ ] FTL
- [ ] Thompson sampling

### Reinforcement Learning 
- [ ] Q-learning

### Visualization
- [ ] Draw Decision boundary(ies)
