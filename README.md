## How to
Some examples on how to use the algorithms can be found in the file example.py

## Algoritms

### Machine Leaning
- [x] KNN (classifier+regressor)
- [x] LDA/QDA
- [x] Logistic Regression/ Perceptron
- [x] Linear regression / Ridge regression (+classification)
- [x] Naive Bayes (Bernoulli, Gaussian and Multinomial)
- [ ] SVM
- [x] Decision Tree CART (cfl + reg)
- [ ] MCMC
- [ ] Gaussian process regression
- [ ] Hidden Markov model
- [ ] Multivariate adaptive regression spline

### Ensemble methods
- [x] Random Forest
- [ ] Gradient Boosting
- [ ] AdaBoost
- [ ] One vs rest/ One vs one classifier 

### Deep Leaning
- [x] MLP (to refactor)
- [ ] VAE ? (Partially done in class)
- [ ] GAN ?
- [ ] CNN ?? (simply a layer compatible with MLP ??)
- [ ] RNN/LSTM ?? (simply a layer compatible with MLP ??)
- [ ] Transformer ?
  
### Clustering
- [x] K-means
- [x] K-medoids
- [x] DBSCAN
- [ ] OPTICS
- [ ] Gaussian Mixture
- [ ] EM algo

### Data processing/Analysis
- [ ] PCA
- [ ] FDA
- [ ] ICA
